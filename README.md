This repository is a place for me to share bookmarklet scripts I create for the browser game, Flight Rising.

## General usage for bookmarklet scripts
Open your browser's bookmark manager, create a bookmark, and paste the javascript code into the URL/address/location field.

## checkHoard.js

### What it does...
Loops through 28 select elements with names v0-v27. If the element has more than 5 options, set the value to the total number of options minus 1, and check the corresponding checkbox.

For example, on the Hoard > Food page, using this will allow you to keep 5 of each food stack.
